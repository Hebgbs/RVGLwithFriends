About.
This track is made in Blender 2.70 using the Jigebren Plugin.
The idea of this track started more then a year ago.
First I made some preparations for an industrial area track but
during that project the idea changed to an indoor track.
Around March of 2014 I managed to create a raw track which I was able to build on.
With some help of Jigebren and some help on RVLive I was able to finish version 1.0.

---

Applications.
I used Blender 2.70 and Photoshop CS2.

---

Textures.
I made all the bitmaps designs myself. 
Some images, like signs, metal doors and the brick wall ect. are not mine and came from texture libraries or found via a search engine.

About the track.
The track uses .viziboxes as optimal as possible.
Also the track uses a custom folder. In this custom folder you will find ABCblock.hul and ABCblock.m which is a brick. (revolt 1.2 only)
The *.fob is loaded from the custom folder so older versions of Revolt also are supported. (no brick objects)
The .ncp is optimized and I kept the size as small as possible.
The track has 4 shortcuts, or on 4 places you can choose which directions you may go.
No reverse mode yet.

---

Technical data.
(.w) has 10763 vertices (9708 faces).
(.ncp) has 2587 vertices (3143 faces).
I did a quick game gauge test:
171.64 Re-Volt v1.00
112 Min
244 Max
This is using the 1024x1024 texures. You can imagine what the fps will do if you use the 512x512 textures.
My personal settings are 1024x600 windowed mode, using the LINEAR TEXTURE FILTER in the advanced  (video) render settings.
I think the LINEAR texture filter displays the_bunker textures better. (no flickering lines in distance).

---

Known bugs.
Although I know that there will be more, I only found 1 bug so far.
Racing the track backwards jumping over a specific threshold will crash and flip the car, in some cases.
I didn't found out why the car should do that.
Please report bugs to [mail at javildesign dot com] so I can update the track if needed.

Thanks.
Thanks to Jigebren for the awesome plugin and the help he gave me.
Thanks to the people on RVLive forum that helped me understand some parts of the MAKEITGOOD mode.

---

Donations.
I have spent a lot of time making this track (about 8 months).
To keep me motivated, donations are always welcome.
