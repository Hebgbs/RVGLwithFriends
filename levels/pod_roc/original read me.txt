This is the second track from the game POD: Planet of Death, this track has a really dark mood that I love, even though it's a tad short.
The next track will be much longer, don't you worry >:)

Tools used: Ninja Ripper, bl4viewer, Blender (With Marv's plugin), Paint.NET

Special thanks to RiffRaff (Leadbest) for inspiring me to make these convertions!
