===DESCRIPTION===

Original Description: This is the second track from the game POD: Planet of Death, this track has a really dark mood that I love, even though it's a tad short.
The next track will be much longer, don't you worry >:)

Update: I added the rotating radar that was missing when I first converted this track, as well as what you would expect, animated sky, effects, HUD elements, custom powerups and sounds.
