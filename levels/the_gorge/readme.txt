Description:
A new idea using the pieces in JimK's Dirt Track kit. Has plenty of level changes as well as some good jumps. Not the usual flat layout.  


Creation:
I started with Jim's kit and made the layout including the canyon walls and eyecandy. The FPS were so bad after glueing it that I finally with the help of RV-Glue & Z-Mod imported the mesh into 3Ds Max and began to explode it. The result was a drastic improvement in FPS. I think that this track rivals the acclaim levels in its the FPS issue. One thing I should mention is that, if you use alot of custom vehicles your FPS will not be so good. This is due to most custom cars being high poly with no LOD present in the mesh.  


Tools Used:
JimK's Dirt Track Kit
RV-Glue
3Ds Max 4.0

Thanks:
Thanks go out to the entire community and especially to Wayne Lemonds because without his support during GA Games romp through our lovely community the RV scene would have probably died because his message board helped keep people around and interested.

Special Thanks:
JimK for the kit
