Description
------------

"Tundra" ("Battle 3" in N64 North-American release) is one of the 8 battle areas found in console versions of San Francisco Rush 2049.

This track includes a reverse mode, a little longer because all shortcuts were removed.

Includes original DC/MAT3 music, "Starsky" by Barry Leitch.


December 22nd, 2015 update
---------------------------

- Fixed invisible wall collision before the last jump.
- It's now impossible to get a X when doing a tight 180 left turn after the second jump or by lounging the wall. Some barriers were added to prevent this. Unfortunetly, this cause the track to be about 1 second longer.

Thanks to Last_Cuban for reporting these 2 bugs.
