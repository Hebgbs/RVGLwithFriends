+ Description   +
*=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=*
 Away Far away from NewVolt city, exists a lost village called "bro ken-san lit" which nobody visit nomore.
 At the broken Sunlight, "bro ken-san lit" race was held, from mayan statues to latin mines and middle age tools.

+ Re-Volt 1.2a  +
*=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=*
 Re-Volt 1.0, 1.1 (Patch 09.16 and 12.07) are obsolete.
 Consider upgrading to the latest Re-Volt 1.2 alpha.

+   Frame Rate  +
*=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=*
 Sadly, we've optimized the track many times, converted some 32-bit bitmaps to 24 ones, done visiboxes,
  yet,  the frame rate is still low compared to other tracks.
   Well, it's possible to lower resolution or access .inf file and lower FOGSTART and FARCLIP to get good results.

Textures are from the internet (two are borrowed from Country Club)
Skybox converted from redsorceress

The old ASE2W keeps aborting the export so We had to modify the sources to make 'If Length = 0' Do Warning 
instead of Error + fixed morph's SG 1 and 2 to become 'Normal1', 'Normal2' instead of 'Windy1','Windy2'.
 (Visual C++ 2008 runtime is required in case you're interested)
