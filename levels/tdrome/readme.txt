Description:

Ladies & gentlemen, boys & girls....... Driving time's here.

This here is a short oval track. Now that doesn't sound exciting, but this is littered with pickups, making this a battle track in disguise as a race. Inspired by Velodrome tracks, it's designed to make cars go fast, without letting go of the throttle, like the Daytona Superspeedway. You'll get a running start from the upper platform, instead of being placed at the dirt or the banked track. One vital recommendation is set the laps to 10 or more, or the race would be very short. Seriously, it's like ~10 seconds a lap; more if you get hit.

This is technically my 4th venture on making levels from scratch. The first is The Arena, the second is Klashers 888, and the 3rd is the cancelled Midwich Alley. The reason being was because Midwich is a little too huge for me to handle as the polycount went significantly higher, making the experience awfully laggy on inferior hardware.

PS: Don't make your overpowered cars CPU SELECTABLE. 

First off, you be like "Mace, why does the colors look so compressed?" This is an artistic choice to limit myself down to the 256-color VGA artstyle seen in old DOS games, like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, etc. The color palette is taken from Sonic Robo Blast 2, an impressive looking fan game running on a modified Doom engine. There are some inaccuracies, mainly the use of semi-transparency and vertex painting. 

Another thing is the removal of some assets, mainly the music which I wanted a few, but taken out due to file size restrictions on RVZ. Probably for the best, because they're just .OGG files. Only problem with the track is that due to the large amounts of lights (strobes used for effects), the shader version can't show all of it, until the shader version's light issue is resolved.
