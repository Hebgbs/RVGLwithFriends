Description
-----------------
It's been a while. Six years since I last released a proper track.

The base was made in ZModeler, modified a bit in Blender, spiced up with PRM kits. The raceline is relatively straightforward, with plenty of obstacles that won't necessarily be a nuisance or get in your way, but their presence will keep you on your toes.
