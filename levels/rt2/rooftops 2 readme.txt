Well this is the first track in 2 years from me and it is the start of many follow up tracks and new ideas and themes.

Rooftops was always one of my fave tracks so i just had to make another one.
Made entirely in 3D studio max by my self I use the original Textures from Roof 1 and a few others so thanks to Acclaim entertainment (the late Acclaim Entertainment) for creating this still stunning racer.

It is a fast flowing but very technical track as far as the race line goes.

Please Please Please!! Check out the replays, because one of the last Longtime Re volters and a good buddy of mine SuPeRTaRD did one hell of a great job on the cameras in this one and I wish to thank him loads for his time and effort.

Also Thanks go out to a few others who helped with the Testing and Revolt (makeitgood) editing part:

ManMountain for the AI and pos node, Trackzone tweaking cheers mate.

DSL Tile, SlowJustice, Hil9, AGT (BMQs)  Kv, KilRoy for putting it through its paces and being very handy and helpfull in mirc and are always around to put fireworks up my tailpipe. thanx guys.

Well its been almost 6 years since i started playing Re Volt and I hope lots of you still enjoy it as much as I and a few others do.
