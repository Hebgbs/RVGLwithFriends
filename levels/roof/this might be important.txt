Now that I have your attention, let's read something that's actually relevant...

Track Name---  Rooftops 2011

Author---         Dave-o-rama

Type---    Extreme/Stock

Length---    588m

Directions---    Standard stuff... Just unzip in the main Re-volt folder, then everything should be set.

Description---  Rooftops as it was made on the Dreamcast... sounds, chopper, everything. 

Re-Volt 1.1 is obsolete--- You NEED WolfR4 or the 1.2 update for Re-Volt if you have any hopes of running this track properly. Go to http://jigebren.free.fr/ for WolfR4 or rv12.zackattackgames.net for Re-Volt 1.2.
