Trivia:

-The front gate was from fairground 1, but it was removed due to thematic and pacing issues. The rocket ride was from an earlier build of fairground 2, but now rebuilt better.
-Textures were built using pictures from a real fairground. The Terroride sign was from a photo GJ took in 2006.
-In areas of the reference fairground, there were so many cigarettes littered on the ground that they were jokingly considered to be included in the main ground textures. They made it in as instances instead.
-The after hours setting was decided upon partially to differentiate it from the other tracks; it creates an interesting contrast between the motion and noises seen in fairground 2 especially.

I SPY is reclusive, but if all else fails you can try to contact him instead. He also isn't a spy that's just his name.
