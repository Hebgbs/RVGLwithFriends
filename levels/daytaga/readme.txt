*Description*
--------------
This track is based on a sketch by DSL_Tile.  The similar layout to
Daytona International Raceway soon became apparent, but is by no means
a scale or semi-scale mock-up.

Also be sure to get the soon released Nascar cars 
from the RVCC team, they will fit the track well.


* Tips/Gameplay *
--------

First person to get the star is "it".  If you are "it" you
will glow green till someone touches you.  First person to
stay "it" for 2 minutes wins. Battle-tag is a multi-player
game "option".  If you have no-one to play multi with, can
start a "fake" multiplayer game as the HOST then hit tab
in the "waiting for players screen", if you want to
practice a long time, avoid the star.

If you would like to disable the boobies feature:
go to options-video-rendersettings & disable the instances.
(only the novbos will disappear)

* Installation *
----------------
Backup or delete /levels/bot_bat/
Unzip with folder names to your /revolt/ folder, or
