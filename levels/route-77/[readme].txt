Long info:
----------

This track is the outside part of The Bunker. Noticed the metal closed door in both tracks. The track is 636 meters long. The info about the length in the tunnels is not accurate. The track is RVGL only.

Started in December 2018 with a curve and some generated mountains in Blender. Soon it became a serious project with gigabytes of .blend and .psd files.
I made a lot of mistakes during the development. But I learned a lot from it. If I could do this project again, I would do it differently and it would be less time consuming.

I baked most of the lightning in Blender. It is not 100% accurate and I adjusted it a million times afterwards. All the cones are moveable and there is a reverse mode available, which is just a little bit different.
On some parts of the track if you listen carefully you will hear just one bird whistling. I recorded this bird's sound with my smartphone a while ago.

Route-77 will first be released in September 2019 on http://www.revoltxtg.co.uk.


Design Info and Errors
----------------------

I tried to avoid getting stuck on parts of the track. Sometimes it happends that a car does weird things when hitting an object with high speed.
It is possible to get stuck directly on top of a wooden plank, not an error! Slow down!

I tested the track only with the original cars. Big-Volt alike cars can get stuk under some wooden fences, so avoid those. 
There are parts in the track where you can or cannot drive through polygons, to avoid getting stuck.
Have fun and contact me if you find some errors.
