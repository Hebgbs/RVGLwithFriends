This track is originally made by Nintendo Co. Ltd. for the game "Super Mario Kart" and then remade as a retro track for the game "Mario Kart Wii".
This is a coversion using the models from Mario Kart Wii and adapted to fit the size of RVGL cars. I do not own this track's model, textures or concept. 

Creator notes: This is the second of (I hope) multiple conversions from Mario Kart Wii. I chose to not include music for copyright issues.

Technical notes: The track's surface is wood instead of simple asphalt, I thought it would create a bit of challenge and variety.
You can drive wherever you want, even on the sides of the track if you really feel the need to. There is not much else to drive, and falling off is an instant repo.
You can jump over the wall to cut some time, if you manage to jump of course.
There is one time split instead of the usual 3 because the track is pretty short (only 15 seconds with toyeca).
I copied the item sets from MKWii, although in the original game the second and the third item set move around (not possible in this game).
In this track there will always be 21 pickups (+ 1 star) regardless of the number of players. This allows for even matches where everyone can get an item. The side effect is that races will a bit more chaotic, but I prefer that to unfair.
You can race in reverse even though the original game never allowed so (maybe in one of the Mario Kart Channel Event). In reverse, the first item set was moved to be in front of the grid (instead of behind) and the last item was moved behind the grid.
This track is pretty short and I would advise 5 or even 10 laps instead of the usual 3. 
I rated this track as "Medium", since it's layout is easy to understand, but contains a few caveats that make it a step harder than other SNES tracks. 

I will repeat this more than one time: you can take whatever path fits you best. You can take the jump cut, there is no reposition trigger to prevent this. You can also jump over the walls to skip sections of the track.

Thank you for playing RVGL in 2020 and for downloading this track. I hope you enjoy.

You may not publish an edited version this track without my permission, unless I've been out of the RVGL scene for a couple years. If I leave and return, I reserve any right to undo any edit you made to the track.
This track is part of the MKWii Conversion Project for RVGL. It will include (I hope) all the 32 stock tracks in Mario Kart Wii, complete with reverse version if possible (sorry, no reverse on Rainbow Road).
