Overview:

The Trippple 8 Rallycross, AKA: The Trippple 8 is my first track (but 2nd map) made in Blender from the ground up. It was inspired by the 1995 Codemasters classic, Super Skidmarks. Super Skidmarks is an isometric racer where you race around in small maps. It is a gem on the Mega Drive (since it was only released in PAL regions). 

The start of the Trippple 8 begins with an idea of a simple race map. The first design wasn't a figure 8, but a lot more complex. It was going to have a sidewalk in the middle of the track for more asphalt traction. The first design didn't worked out as it was a complete mess. The second design was collaged together from the Super Skidmarks tracks, and how the design got it's name.

LORE:

The Klashers. One of the several RC Factions in a small town of Chesterwood, but the most infamous of them all. The gang was formed in 1993 by several high school teenagers who are new to the RC racing scene. The original founders weren't the ones who made the Klasher's infamy, as they were just humble skaters who has a new passion for small-scaled RCs. Since 1997-onwards, the Klasher leaders has been passed on for several generations, and the one who lead the Klasher's infamous reputation was their current leader, Vincent Gonzalez, but you just call him Vigo. Vigo became the leader in 2016, and he has a different way to win races: Cheating. He was also one of the more clever cheaters in the tournament, as he & his clan managed to reach the quarter-finals in the Chesterwood R/C Nationals, several times by using a bit more aggressive & dirty methods.

The Klashers home turf lays outside of Greene Beach, which was located at the far west side of town. Formerly, there was a skatepark that sits nearby, but since the flood in 2004, most of the skatepark was destroyed. The Klashers' tracks prior to the flood mostly resides the very skatepark as their source of asphalt, apart from the sand. Many of their tracks are done my the Klashers themselves, and some were helped by outside sources. They made many sand-based tracks inspired by various motocross arenas, and one of their tracks that The Klashers are most famous for is their "Trippple 8 Rallycross" made in 2008. Three Figure-8 tracks seamed together with 5 intersections, and one of the most challenging & hectic tracks in the R/C Nationals. From 2010-onwards, the Klasher tracks are heavily inspired by the Trippple 8, some gave it new features like better jumps and asphalt. This version shown lies between the original 2008 version - the 2013 variant.
