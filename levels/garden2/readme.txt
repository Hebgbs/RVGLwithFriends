* Description *
---------------
What should I say? It's the sequel to the botanical garden, the only original Acclaim track with just one version. Everyone loved the original so here's the missing 2nd part of it. Nuff said :)


* Technical data *
------------------
This is the first officially released track that is only made out of instances. You won't find a single track editor piece in this one, whether this is good or not will be judged by you. However, as it becomes popular to show up with tech details, I don't want to miss the hype :)

What's in it?

- Shortcuts and pickup routes. Every route is driveable, just try and see.
- Lots of head-to-head action. The track turns around at a u-turn so you'll race the whole track back until you u-turn again.
- Hand made AI. Since I didn't use the track editor, I had to do it by hand (bleargh!).
- Lots of custom instances you've never seen before.


What's NOT in it?

- An ass-kicking-road-ripping-dust-blowing-AI. The possibilities of tweaking the AI go very far, it's no problem to create AI lines you'll never be able to beat. But what I tried was to set up an AI that is similar to the original tracks, fast but very precise. And so it's still hard to beat, but not impossible!
- Replay cameras. I seldom watch a replay of me driving (although I should - to become a better driver :)) and I don't think many people ever did. So I refused to take all the hassle of creating visiboxes, cam rails and triggers. Well, if someone else wants to create replay cams for this track, feel free to do so, mail them to me and I'll release an update for it.
- Needless difficulties. The original tracks differ between "easy", "medium", "hard" and "extreme" and I didn't want to set up a new category called "ultra hardcore". So this track fits in the category "extreme" and you should be able to win it after some days.


* Tips/Hints *
--------------
Nothing special. Every stock car will fit this track, just drive fast and try to hold the line :) Pickups can be hard to achieve, but as there are not too much of them placed, you'll need to take some extra routes if you're more of a fighter than a driver.


* Bugs/Problems *
-----------------
- Instances
You might get stuck under the bridge (although I tried to avoid this) and in some other instances (very very seldom). This is a bug I'm aware of but I couldn't fix it without the original Acclaim tools (which I don't have *sigh*). I placed reposition triggers where necessary to ensure that you'll be beamed onto the track as soon as possible.

- System crash (bye bye and back to desktop)
Also very seldom, but this depends on your system. I had to work at the absolute limit of the ingame tools Acclaim offered us and so it might be that your system is not capable to display all the stuff I've thrown onto the track and decides to collapse. I encountered this bug 2 times (while playing the track about a thousand times).

- Blue cars
Although you can't speak of a real "bug", I noticed that the AI cars sometimes turn blue (the fog and sky color) for a few seconds. Who cares? :)


* Installation *
----------------
Just unzip all files from "garden2.zip" into your Re-Volt folder, they will automatically be extracted into the right subfolders. Start the game, choose the track and - imagine some crickets chirp while you blow the leaves off the trees!


* Copyright/Permissions *
-------------------------
Some textures and instances I used for this track are from the original garden track (© by Acclaim Studios) and a few other textures are from the game "Unreal Tournament" (© by Epic Games), the rest is from me. You are NOT allowed to commercially exploit this track, i.e. put it on a CD or any other electronic medium that is sold for money. You MAY use the texture set for your own tracks as long as you include this copyright information.


* Thanks and credits go to *

Just take a close look at the track and you'll know :)
