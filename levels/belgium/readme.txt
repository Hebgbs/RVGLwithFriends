** Description:   Belgium is a real country and not just a part of France.  
                         It has a government and culture, everything a real country
                         has.  It is rarely in the news, but believe me it does exist.
                         It is famous for waffles, lace, and fried potato strips (called
                         French Fries in English because people have heard of France).
                         The most well known people born in Belgium are Hercule Poirot
                         and the great actor Jean-Claude Van Damme.
                                                                  ---Sir hilaire9, world traveler
