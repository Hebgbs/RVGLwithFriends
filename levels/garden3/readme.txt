Garden3   By SKITCH2.

Hi all. 

Instalation: extract the zipp to you revolt dir.

This is the first track that i have made entirely in 3d max.

The aim was to create a track as close to the quality of the original Re_Volt levels.

I would like to thank. Antimorph, Ali, scloink, tripp6s, ST, LaserBeams and all the other peeps who have given me advice
in the chat room.

Keep a look out for more track at my website:http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/SKITCH2
If there are any buggs in the track ( which there probably is ) please let me know at
skich2@hot mail.com.  I have left the t out of my e mail address so dont try to put it in as you will get sombody else :)

Thanx again and have fun.

"Scooby doo world" is the next main project but another battle tag level will arrive soon.
