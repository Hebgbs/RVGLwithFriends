----- Description:  The abandoned Misty Valley Silver Mine is located
                                 near Beaverhead, Idaho.  It opened in 1895, but was closed
                                 in 1901 due to the embezzlement of investors' funds by 
                                 the Treasurer,  a Mr. Winfred Peabody.  Only traces of
                                 silver were ever found in Misty Valley.
