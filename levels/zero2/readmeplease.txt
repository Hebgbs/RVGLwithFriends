AI By Manmountain!

Thanx go out to Manmountain for his hard work and effort with his AI work!! He has done yet another stunning job with this one as it is extremely hard to get right with this type of surface properties!

I shall continue to make tracks for this game as it still means lots to me after 6 years editing.
