Author: Skitch2

Install Folder: breach2

Length: 1172

Install Routine:
Just unzip it to your main ReVolt folder. All files will go where needed. Once you do that go into the main Revolt folder and run the install_hull2Cust.bat file to install the custom images and models for the track. I strongly recommend doing this because they add so much to the track. I also wouldn't want LaserBeams efforts to go unnoticed. He worked so hard on doing this. Thanks LB.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE(huki): The track has now been converted to WolfR4 format.

To enjoy the custom elements of this track, just download the
program WolfR4 from the link below. No batch files are needed.

The year is 3241 and Voyager is continuing its long voyage home.  The ship and her crew have encountered many species and new cultures on its travels, none more formidable as the Borg.

The quantum singularity Voyager encountered was extreamly powerful and breached the hull on decks 16 to18. Engineering was hit hard, rendering the ship powerless and dead in space.
On the bridge, the crew were going over the ships systems one by one, running level 1 diagnostics to find the faults and restore full power.

"Captain!!" It was tom Paris at the helm.
"Yes Tom" Captain Janeway replied.
" Long range sensors have picked up a ship that is closing in on our position."
" Match there sensor readings with our computers memory banks, see if anything comes up."
Ensign Kim started pushing the lit buttons at his console.
"There hailing us Captain" Tom Paris yelled.
"On screen" 
On Janeways command a crackly broken image was displayed on the viewscreen and it was followed by static noise.
" Try to clean that up a little Ensign"
"Aye Captain" Kim replied.

"We are Borg. Lower you shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us…..
Resistance is Futile…….

"Red alert, all hands to battle stations."
