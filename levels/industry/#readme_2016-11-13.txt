- (Hopefully) ghettofixed the .w file to prevent glitches
- Changed some textures
- Converted bitmaps to PNG and enabled alpha transparency on objects that need it
- Removed custom HUD and custom pickup.m
- Removed waterboxes that have been used to animate plants
- New loading screen


You need RVGL from http://rv12.revoltzone.net/rvgl.php to play this track.

Rename industry_rename_if_bad_performance_.vis to industry.vis if you're experiencing performance issues.
Visiboxes are disabled since some of them cull things that shouldn't be culled.
