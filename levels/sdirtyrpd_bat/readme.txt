-========================================- Information -========================================-

Name: Simple Dirty Raceway Playground
Release date: 2012-11-03
Folder name: SDirtyRPd_bat
Track Type: Battle Tag
Custom Features: Loading screen
Bonus Features: Yes (rain)

Latest RVGL patch is recommended to play this track. (Oldest compatible - v1.2 Alpha 12.0815)

                                          /-*********-\
-========================================- Description -========================================-

Nothing really fancy here. It is what it says: just simple, dirty, raceway playground.
The track was made with JimK's Off-Road kit, there are almost no texture modifications.
What is so special about it is that you can play in any game mode, which is I believe the first
Re-Volt extreme track ever to do this. Besides game modes, there are some bonus stuff.

Arena layout is quite open, so that's a great point for Battle Tag and Stunt Arena modes.
It includes various ramps, a pool with water, some trees, objects like: bottles, beach ball and cones.
Good way to just simply mess around in the track.
As for racing layout, it is really short and simple. I couldn't make the raceline very long due to game's limited engine.
Stunt Arena and Battle Tag needs open areas, and supporting all games modes is a difficult task to do.

This was my first ever publicly released track for Re-Volt.

Features:

 -Rain option (on/off, off by default)
 -3 secrets ("Easter eggs") to find with F6 (free view) camera

                                         /-**********-\
-=======================================- Installation -========================================-

                                        /-************-\
-======================================- Bonus Features -=======================================-

 -Rain (on/off) - Enables rain, makes the sky darker and adds rainy background sounds. Reminiscent of "Toytanic 2".
	(default off)

Copy SDirtyRPd_bat.fob file from "rain" folder to "custom" to enable it.

                                        /-************-\

                                         /-**********-\
-=======================================- Known issues =========================================-
Known bugs which are impossible or too difficult to fix for me.

 -Some hardly noticeable holes on the ground (visible blue skybox). No effect to the player car.
 -There are 2 or 3 places where textures collide, they cause overlapping. Not really annoying.

                                            /-****-\
-==========================================- Trivia -===========================================-

 -First Re-Volt track to be compatible with all game modes: Single Race, Stunt Arena, Battle Tag...
 -Arena was meant to be only played on Stunt Arena and Battle Tag modes, the track was called "Dirt Track Arena Battle".
 -Original track was rebuilded at least 2 times, because it had too many graphical glitches.
   Racelines were slightly different. (Archives are lost)
 -Track development was on hold for a whole year. Main layout was done in 2011, finished in 2012.
 -Topdown camera idea was influenced from Dave-o-rama's "Canyon of the Wolves" track.
