Despite being a rookie vehicle, don't expect this buggy to do you any favors. Equipped with a powerful high accelerating motor, but sub par tires, the car spins out easily at low speeds. As a result, keeping your speed up is vital if you want to win any races.

Anyways thank you for downloading, and I hope you have fun with this car!
This car includes a paintkit which you can use as a template to make new skins with.
