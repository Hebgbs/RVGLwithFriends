This car is a remodel of the Traxxas Tmaxx by RVCC. I made this as a fun stock like vehicle to simply cause havoc on the track with. If you cant beat the small sports cars and buggies you're going to be up against in the Pro class, you can at least bully them to victory!

special thanks to FZG/Ziggy for the wheel texture.
