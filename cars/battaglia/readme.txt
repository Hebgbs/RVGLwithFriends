A Battle Machine with extreme resilience

Battaglia is a sports truck made with the battlefield in mind.
the car's weight exceeds the usual scale because of the large engine on its back.
no performance is compromised in the goal of creating a Battle Machine.

its large engine improves its weight for resilience while generating lots of power.
the body's slanted design improves its aerodynamics, assisting in speed and acceleration.
its soft suspension setup and high ride height allows the car to drive on any terrain unhindered.

Battaglia is made to be very durable and resilient, able to take on any terrains and crash other cars with ease.
its durability and weight prevents the car from being pushed and able to resist pickups, with zap and oils having less effect on this machine.
this car has semi-pro performance. however, due to its extreme durability and ease of use, this car can compete against pros, although requires intentional crashing attempts to keep up.

The outrageous resilience, uncompromised performance and terrain adaptability makes Battaglia to be one of the most formidable Battle Machine available.
