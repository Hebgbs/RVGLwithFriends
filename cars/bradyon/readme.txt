Car Information

Car name : Bradyon
Car Type : Repaint/Reparam/Remap/Rehull/Reshade
Top Speed : 41mph / 67kph
Rating/Class : 4 (pro)
Install folder : ...\cars\bradyon
Description: Modification of Aeon's Tachyon.

Only thing left over from the original is the baseline mesh, everything else (mapping, vertex shading, shadow, hull) has been re-made. Wheels are taken off of Zipper and also remapped.

Handling is somewhat similar to RG1, though a bit heavier. It turns rather slowly, requiring you to either lay on the brakes or lose the rear every so often.
It's wide and flat, so once its flipped it's not getting back up until you flip it back yourself.
