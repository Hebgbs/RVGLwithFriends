Car description         : My, first real racing car for re-volt, it is the new Dogde Viper GTS-R 			  2000 Concept.  I have spend a long time working on this car, trying to 			  get the mesh, textures and performance right.  This car goes about 			          44mph, has decent accelleration and handling.  I did not want to make 			  it a supercar.  I hope you have as much fun racing with this one as I 			  did making it.  

Class			: Pro

Engine			: Glow

Other info              : Made from scratch using 5 pictures from www.supercars.net.  Also 			          includes custom Y-spoke wheels.  Some of the Car "Gloss" is distorted 			  from some angles, especially at the start of the Garden track.  I tried 			  for ages to try and fix this, but I had no luck.  If anyone knows how 			  to fix this please email me
