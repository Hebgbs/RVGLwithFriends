Description
-----------------
An old project coming to life after spending nearly two years in limbo.

Based off of the Vector W8, it has high top speed and good acceleration for the class, with its only downside being its quirky handling and recovery.

Expect it to be a top contender in the right hands on less technical tracks.


Requirements
-----------------
You MUST use the latest RVGL patch for the textures to display properly.
