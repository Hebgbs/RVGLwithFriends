Description
-----------------
A remodel of Skyedge, fine-tuned for a challenging yet rewarding drive in the Super Pro class. With extremely agile four-wheel steering, high acceleration and above average top speed, the results this car gets is entirely down to who drives it.

In the late 1990s emerged a mysterious individual who would single-handedly change the R/C racing world, with their custom made prototype smashing records on tracks like the Keitune Racing Speedway that wouldn't be matched for another two decades.

The individual modified a the late 90s variant of the Nishida Skyhigh. Donning a pink, innocent paintjob, the prototype - named "Hanabira" - would require someone to be one with this car's ability to flow around any racetrack, like a petal in the wind.

Enthusiasts in the R/C world could never figure out how the prototype had so much success at first, but eventually came to the conclusion that it was down to its extreme four-wheel steering and raw performance - but most importantly, the one controlling it.

This prototype would later prove to be a benchmark for all the major players in the R/C scene, like Toy-Volt, as they begin work on their Toy-Volt ULTRA line.
