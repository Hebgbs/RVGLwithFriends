This is the dev Bike, found in the dev version of Re-Volt and made drivable by combined efforts of Zipperrulez, Burner94 and me (Citywalker). 

Burner made a superb skin for the bike, but I just _had_ to detach the rear wheel (I’m starting to be a modeller this way... :P). I also tweaked the parameters a bit, made it tumbling properly, and tried to reduce the understeer somewhat (unsuccessfully, I must say). 

It’s a good ride, with suspension and all (Burner’s parameters were essentially good, actually), a bit understeering, but still fun. 

Also has a good AI, i.e. the simplified AI:
