===================== Lore/Description =========================
================================================================

"In an isolated western town, rumors of the appearance of aliens spread throughout the region. Strange phenomena began to happen, and reports of witnesses reached everyone's ear. At some point, aliens become a plague, and the risk of this catastrophe spreading in other cities was great. Who is going to defend us?"

The "Alien Buster" was a mix of various 1950s vintage pickups designs. I wanted a really rough car, and an old pickup truck came in handy. The idea of a small group interested in defending the vicinity of aliens using a rustic equipment came to mind, I think it was from a movie I watched a long time ago.

Handling resembles BossVolt a little, since the base parameters were its. I made several changes to stay the way I wanted to, and here it is!
