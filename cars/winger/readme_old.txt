As suggested by R6TE, here is the Traxxas Slash VXL.

The aim was to build a detailed car, while still fitting with the visual style of the stock cars.

The parameters have been tweaked to be balanced with the stock Pro cars.

You can freely make a repaint, or use parts of this car (springs, wheels...) as long as you credit me accordingly in your readme.
