Description
-----------------
An attempt to add something exciting to the dreariest class online.

Rear-wheel drive, four-wheel steering for more funky, albeit tricky handling; low top speed but high acceleration allowing it to fight at the front despite its shortcomings.

Expect this to be a top contender in the right hands on less top-speed favoured tracks.


Requirements
-----------------
You MUST use the latest RVGL patch for the textures to display properly.
