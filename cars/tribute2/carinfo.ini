Description=A reshaped and reskinned version of the Psionic F360 with new parameters. 
Intended to be good competition for the Cougar, Humma, AMW and Toyeca-class cars.

giving it good acceleration, though it has some trouble making tight turns. Be prepared 
to use the breaks. Otherwise, this car has excellent stability.
