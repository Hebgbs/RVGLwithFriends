Description
-----------------
At long last, a 911 GT1 stocklike. The 1998 one no less. It's as formidable as it looks.

Sporting good top speed and acceleration, its four-wheel steering makes it slighty twitchy, but the high grip allows it to be tamer than most RWD cars.


Requirements
-----------------
You MUST use the latest RVGL patch for the textures to display properly.
