ORM Family Sedan

Initial release:	1-28-2002

Ingame Name:		Family Sedan

Install directory:	\cars\CL1

Author:			Ordmet

Base:			New Mesh/Textures from scratch;
			Original Hull:		Humma
			Original Params:	Adeon

Editors used:		3D Studio MAX 4.2, Photoshop 6.0, ase2prm,
			hulscale

Known Bugs:		Couldn't get the .hul to fit quite right due to
			the mesh's unusual size. The fore and aft as
			well as the top are pretty good, but the bottom
			is a bit soft. It's not particularly noticeable
			unless you fall slowly off of a curb, so it's
			not too big of a deal.

Description:

 This is the car your grandma drives.
 This is the car that holds your groceries (in the 80's).
 This is not the car that comes to mind when you think about the car
 that "you'd like to own someday."
 This is not the car you wash lovingly by hand on late Sunday
 afternoons (or ever).

 This car follows no styling rules (and breaks most of them).

 This is the Family Sedan.

 Yet another dependable car from the makers of the Woodmobile*. 
(* shamelessly licensed from Chrysler. However, the Family Sedan is an
all-original design. Honest!).

however.
