Description
-----------------
To prevent Steezy's params from going to waste, I transferred them to a new car mostly based off of the Lotus Esprit GT1. The stats are the same, the handling is similiar, but the dimensions of the car, and as a result, its different wheel offsets will make it ever so slightly different to drive.

The paintjob is also inspired by one of Steezy's skins.

Requirements
-----------------
You MUST use the latest RVGL patch for the textures to display properly.
