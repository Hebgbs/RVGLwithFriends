Lore
-----------------
The Toyama Heritage is a much-revered sportscar, emerging as the flagship for the Japanese manufacturer in the late 90s. Toy-Volt made quick haste towards securing a deal with them, ensuring them the rights to create high-quality R/C cars based off of it.
This is the sixth-generation model, with the livery based off one of of their real-life racing counterparts. Toy-Volt fine-tuned the performance of the Heritage R/C car to boast speed and cornering for those interested in taking the car to the track on a more semi-professional level.
Unlike the previous generations however, this one sports experimental four-wheel steering technology, which sparked a lot of controversy by enthusiast circles. But as those open-minded give themselves time to learn the nuances of the sixth-generation Toyama Heritage R/C car, one will quickly understand what the name alludes to.
Much like the real-life variant, it builds upon the past what made the car popular in the first place, its heritage, and ensures it's ready for what the future brings forth, be it enthusiasm in the corners, or hardship along the way.
